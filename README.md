  * Data is "updated twice per week"; from what I can tell it's updated on Sunday and Wednesday
* [Github](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking)
  * This didn't prove to be too terribly useful; it houses the repos for their main data products

## Build

1. Run the `make.bat` script from the Windows command line
   1. The script executes `mungeData.R`, which creates the source data file, `Data\disparity_data.csv`, for the Tableau workbook
   2. The data file is timestamped and version controlled
2. Publish `Covid19 Racial and Ethnic Disparity.twb` to the internal Tableau server


## To do:

* Investigate why AI/AN for Washington does not get flagged as disparate (where it does in the CRDT dashboard)
  * I suspect CRDT's flag is a result of rounding/precision error
  * Could also be that the ACS data I'm pulling is not the same as the ACS data CRDT uses
  * Email query sent to racial.data@covidtracking.com on 2020-07-07
* **[Won't fix]** Fix the doughnut hole selection issue
  * Does not seem possible without sacrificing other functionality
  * https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000C6ZzESAV/doughnut-selectionhover-issue
* Automate or semi-automate the build workflow
  * Would like to combine steps 1 and 2
* Add "the" before "District of Columbia"
* Duplicate ranking dashboard for `disparity_excess_pct`


## Press

* The NY Times has some disparity data I would like to get my hands on
  * https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html
  * Their data is from the CDC and was obtained by a FOIA request
* Northwestern also has some disparity data
  * https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2020/covid-magnifies-racial-disparities.html
  * Survey data and not broken out by state
